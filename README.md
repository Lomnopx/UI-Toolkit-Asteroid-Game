Benefits and drawback of Ui toolkit.

Making the actual Ui is very intuative and simple. You can kinda like play around and try different themes and change thing around very effectively. 
Adding the ui to the game with bound values and attributes was very confusing to me and felt a bit overly complicated. 
It's also kinda strange to to be able to make changes to the ui like position etz from the editor or scene.
The main value seems to be the flexibility and separation of ui and code for the ui. I could imagine that a designer would prefer to use ui toolkit.

Using scriptable objects seems very useful for holding stat values. I never knew it existed and it seems kinda amazing for especially this use case.
The only negative thing I can think of is that it can be annoying that values donâ€™t reset after the runtime in the Editor. 
This though can be solved by having a static value that set the flexible value as for example. CurrentHealth = Maxhealth; or Maxhealth = DefaultMaxHealth;
